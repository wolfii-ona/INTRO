# Introduction
Hi, this is Hsinwei Chang! You can also call me Fiona (how my friends in the US usually do)

ðŸ§­I was born and raised in Taiwan, and I am currently a sophomore student at De Anza College.

ðŸ§­Still a newbie to the GitHub community, but I'll try my best to produce projects on a monthly basis.

ðŸ§­Currently enrolled in CS50x 2025. Projected to finish the course by the end of September.

Please do not hesitate to connect/ reach out to me! I am open to everything that can make me grow :D
